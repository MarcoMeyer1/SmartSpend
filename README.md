## Documentation

### Purpose of the App
SmartSpend is a way for you to manage and control your finances all in one application. It is a great way to see how you are spending your money and see where it is all going. This gives all the users a way to control and track all their finances, from seeing your expenses and income history to setting saving and purchasing goals. SmartSpend is a brilliant and efficient way to track all of these things while having an easy time navigating the application.

### Design Considerations
The SmartSpend team has considered that a dark theme would suit this application, the light black and green tones compliments the application well. We have also added a color feature for our categories so the user can easily track what they are spending their money on for each category. It gives the user a better experience seeing the color they have designated for that category instead of searching for it if each category was the same.

### Utilisation of GitHub and GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions are used to automatically trigger unit tests upon each commit, ensuring code quality is maintained throughout the development process. The use of `dorny/test-reporter@v1` neatly formats the test results, providing clear feedback on test success or failure directly within the GitHub interface.
