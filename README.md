# Comprehensive Report
## Purpose of the app
SmartSpend is a way for you to manage and control your finances all in one application. It is a great way to see how you are spending your money and see where it is all going. This gives all the users a way to control and track all their finances, from seeing your expenses and income history to setting saving and purchasing goals. SmartSpend is a brilliant and efficient way to track all of these things while having an easy time navigating the application.

## Design considerations
The SmartSpend team has considered that a dark theme would suit this application, the light black and green tones compliments the application well, we have also added a colour feature for our categories so the user can easily track what they are spending their money on for each category, it just gives the user a better experience seeing the colour they have designated for that category instead of searching for it if each category was the same.

## Utilisation of Github and Github Actions
GitHub Actions are used to automatically trigger unit tests upon each commit, ensuring code quality is maintained throughout the development process.

The use of dorny/test-reporter@v1 neatly formats the test results, providing clear feedback on test success or failure directly within the GitHub interface.
